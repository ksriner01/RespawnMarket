# RespawnMarket

I plan to create the WebApp project for this class on my own.

I propose to create a video game themed reseller marketplace where people can go to specifically sell their games or gaming computer parts to others who may be looking for a good deal. The name of this reseller marketplace application would be RespawnMarket as respawning is a mechanic in many games where a character comes back to life and this marketplace would allow people to give their parts and games life once more in the hands of someone else.
