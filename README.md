# RespawnMarket

I plan to create the WebApp project for this class on my own.

I propose to create a video game themed reseller marketplace where people can go to specifically sell their games or gaming computer parts to others who may be looking for a good deal. The name of this reseller marketplace application would be RespawnMarket as respawning is a mechanic in many games where a character comes back to life and this marketplace would allow people to give their parts and games life once more in the hands of someone else.

Code used was previously referenced from:
- Dykstra tutorials found here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/data/ef-rp/intro?view=aspnetcore-7.0&tabs=visual-studio
- Adam Freeman's book: Pro ASP.NET Core 6: Develop Cloud-Ready Web Applications Using MVC, Blazor, and Razor Pages (2022)

However for the WebApp3 submission I solely used the code from Adam Freeman's Sports Store example found in the book.

Newly Added in WebApp3 submission:
- Full seeded database with Video Games, Computer Components, and Consoles
- Pagination
- Stylization using bootstrap

Current non-working things:
- CRUD features

To be added:
- CRUD features
- Second Db<Set> entity as there is currently only one
- Comments for all pages in the program
- Shopping Cart Capabilities
- In-depth Navigation
