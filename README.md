# RespawnMarket

I plan to create the WebApp project for this class on my own.

I propose to create a video game themed reseller marketplace where people can go to specifically sell their games or gaming computer parts to others who may be looking for a good deal. The name of this reseller marketplace application would be RespawnMarket as respawning is a mechanic in many games where a character comes back to life and this marketplace would allow people to give their parts and games life once more in the hands of someone else.

The DbSet<> objects that I would intend to have in my DbContext class would be the following:

- Product
- Model
- Price

(I'm still not entirely sure if these are appropriate as individual objects but will do some more thinking about proper DbSet<> objects to use in an application with this scope.)
